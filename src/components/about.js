          proud to present our new location on the water at Center Blvd. The

          restaurant, with seating for 160 diners along with an outdoor patio
          seating 60 people and a private dining room. In addition to the dining
          area, Blend on the Water features an amazing spacious bar consisting

          features 10 foot windows that wrap around the restaurant, providing
          breathtaking views of the East River and Manhattan. Blend on the
          Water's menu is our interpretation of Latin cuisine, and is inspired
          by all Latin countries. Come see for yourself why Blend on the Water
          is the ultimate dining experience.
